Each product is assigned a unique QR code, linked to a blockchain ledger recording its origin and journey. Consumers can easily verify authenticity by scanning the QR code, ensuring transparency and trust. This innovative solution offers real-time insights into a product's authenticity and ethical attributes, paving the way for a future free from counterfeit concerns.

In conclusion, the proposed system integrates seamlessly with manufacturers and suppliers, allowing them to add transaction details to the blockchain independently while preserving data integrity. Utilizing Solidity contracts and local testing through Ganache, coupled with MetaMask integration for Ethereum interaction, ensures a reliable and user-friendly experience. With a React-based interface and QR code scanning for end-users to verify product integrity, the system provides a comprehensive solution for supply chain management, leveraging blockchain technology for enhanced transparency and security throughout the process.
